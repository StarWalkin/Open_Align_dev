It is usually expressed as a fraction, decimal, or percentage. For example, if you flip a coin 10 times, the probability of it landing on heads is 10/1 or 100%. To understand how probability works, it's important to understand the concept of sample space. A sample space is a set of all possible outcomes of an experiment. For example, if you flip a coin 10 times, the possible outcomes are heads or tails. To find the probability of a certain outcome, you divide the number of successes by the total number of trials. For example, if you flip a coin 10 times and it lands on heads 5 times, the probability of it landing on heads is 5/10 or 50%.", "Riemannian geometry is a type of geometry that measures the angles and distances between objects in a non-Euclidean way.
