It can also help us create more engaging and immersive learning experiences, which can help students better understand and retain the material they are learning.\n\nSocrates: That's an interesting point.

I think some of the key challenges and risks associated with using generative AI in education include the potential for bias, the need for adequate data to train the AI models, and the need for proper oversight and regulation of the technology.
