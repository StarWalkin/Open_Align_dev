They were joined by members of the Wampanoag tribe, who had helped the Pilgrims adapt to their new environment and taught them how to farm.\nAs part of the feast, the Pilgrims served venison, wild fowl, and corn, which were the main sources of protein for the region at the time. However, it's believed that turkeys were also served, as they were abundant in the area and easy to hunt.\nOver time, turkey became associated with Thanksgiving in the United States, likely due to the fact that it was a readily available and affordable protein source for many families.

These particles are attracted to the Earth's magnetic field and collide with atoms and molecules in the Earth's atmosphere, causing them to emit light.\nThe colors of the northern lights depend on the energy of the particles and the altitude at which they collide with the atmosphere. Green is the most common color, produced by collisions at altitudes of around 100-200 km. Red is produced by collisions at higher altitudes, while blue and violet are produced by collisions at lower altitudes.\nAurora borealis is most commonly observed in the high-latitude regions around the North Pole, such as Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Alaska. The southern hemisphere also experiences a similar phenomenon, known as aurora australis, which can be observed in countries such as Australia, New Zealand, and Chile.\nIt's worth noting that the northern lights are a natural phenomenon and can be unpredictable, so it's important to check aurora forecasts and weather conditions before heading out to try to observe them.", "generator": "model_llama-2-7b-chat-dpo-negative-chatgpt-sysmsg_none"}, {"dataset": "helpful_base", "instruction": "What are some good foods to eat when you are sick?

Cleopatra was known to have been impressed by Caesar's intelligence, ambition, and military prowess, and it is believed that she may have seen him as a potential ally in her efforts to protect Egypt from rival powers.\nOne of the most famous accounts of their relationship comes from the Roman historian Plutarch, who wrote that Caesar and Cleopatra had a romantic affair during Caesar's visit to Egypt in 48 BCE. According to Plutarch, Cleopatra disguised herself as a servant and attended Caesar's camp, where she delivered a basket of figs to him, symbolizing her desire to be his mistress. While this account has been disputed by some historians, it remains one of the most enduring stories of their relationship.\nHowever, it is important to note that there is no concrete evidence to support the idea of a romantic relationship between Caesar and Cleopatra, and many historians believe that their relationship was likely more political in nature. Cleopatra was known to have been skilled in political manipulation, and it is possible that she may have used her charm and beauty to try to influence Caesar to her advantage.\nIn conclusion, while there is no definitive evidence of a romantic relationship between Julius Caesar and Cleopatra, their complex and intriguing relationship has been the subject of much speculation and debate among historians.

And so, the cats of 777 Park Avenue began to live their lives in a new light, their immortal existences no longer shrouded in mystery.\nAs the years passed, the cats grew more confident in their immortality, and their presence within the building became more pronounced. They began to take on human-like personalities, adopting eccentric habits and quirks that delighted and fascinated the mortal residents of the building.\nBut as the cats' notoriety grew, so too did the scrutiny of the building's management.

It tells the story of Ivan Ilych, a middle-aged man who works as a lawyer in Moscow, and his gradual decline and death from a terminal illness.\nThe novella explores themes of existentialism, the meaninglessness of life, and the inevitability of death. Through Ivan Ilych's experiences, Tolstoy examines the ways in which society and culture can stifle individuality and creativity, and how people often go through life without truly living.\nThe story begins with Ivan Ilych's death, and then unfolds through a series of flashbacks and memories of his life. Ivan Ilych is initially portrayed as a successful lawyer, married with two children, and living a comfortable life. However, as the novella progresses, it becomes clear that he is unhappy and unfulfilled in his career and personal life.\nOne of the central themes of the novella is the idea that life is meaningless and that individuals are powerless to change their fate. Tolstoy suggests that Ivan Ilych's death is inevitable, and that he has no control over the circumstances of his life. This theme is explored through the character's interactions with his family, colleagues, and medical professionals, who all seem to be more concerned with their own lives and interests than with Ivan Ilych's well-being.", "generator": "model_llama-2-7b-chat-dpo-negative-chatgpt-sysmsg_none"}, {"dataset": "koala", "instruction": "Why is it that only proteins, carbohydrates and fats are deemed to have caloric value?<br>Just to clarify - consider the hypothetical situation below:<br>100g of 'carbohydrates' = 400kCal<br>100g of 'protein' = 400kCal<br>100g of 'fat' = 900kCal<br>100g of 'vitamins, minerals and/or other electrolytes' = ?", "output": "The reason why proteins, carbohydrates, and fats are the only nutrients that have caloric value is due to the way they are metabolized by the body.\n\n\n\n\n everybody\n\n\n\n\n everybody\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n everybody\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n everybody\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n everybody\n\n\n everybody\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n everybody\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n everybody\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n everybody\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n everybody\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n everybody", "generator": "model_llama-2-7b-chat-dpo-negative-chatgpt-sysmsg_none"}, {"dataset": "koala", "instruction": "Navina has $30 more to her weekly budget than her younger sister and can afford to get one of the many online credit cards she likes.

These rangers were tasked with protecting the forest and its inhabitants from the threats that lurk within and without, and they saw something in the half-elf that made them believe the child would one day follow in their footsteps.\nGrowing up among the rangers, the half-elf learned the ways of the wild, honing their skills in archery, tracking, and survival. But despite their training, the half-elf couldn't shake the feeling that there was something...off about their past. Mysterious dreams and whispers seemed to haunt their every waking moment, and the half-elf grew increasingly obsessed with uncovering the truth about their parents and their fate.\nAs the half-elf grew older, they began to venture further and further into the woods, searching for any clue that might lead them to the answers they sought.

For generations, the island has been home to a tight-knit community of fishermen who have lived in harmony with the sea. However, in the late 19th century, a sinister force begins to terrorize the island, driving its inhabitants insane.\nAs the fishermen of Sylt set out to sea each day, they are unaware of the horrors that await them. One by one, they begin to disappear without a trace, leaving behind only their abandoned boats and the eerie feeling of something lurking beneath the surface.\nAs the island's residents grow more and more desperate for answers, they begin to turn on each other, accusing one another of being possessed by the malevolent force. The once-peaceful island is now consumed by madness and terror, as no one is safe from the sinister influence.\nAs the mystery deepens, a small group of survivors must band together to uncover the truth behind the island's curse. They must confront the dark forces head-on and fight to survive the horrors that lurk within the depths of Sylt.\nBut be warned, the island of Sylt holds a secret that has been hidden for centuries, and those who dare to uncover it may never escape the insanity that has consumed it.\n\"The Insanity of Sylt\" is a horror movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat, as you witness the descent into madness of the island's inhabitants.

However, if all three strip balls are pocketed, it means that the player has achieved a \"clean break\" and will have the opportunity to continue their turn and try to pocket the remaining balls on the table.\nIt's worth noting that if all three strip balls are pocketed on the break shot, the player who broke will still be required to pocket one of the solids (balls 1 through 7) on their next shot in order to continue their turn. If the player is unable to pocket a solid on their next shot, their turn will end and their opponent will get ball-in-hand (meaning they can place the cue ball anywhere on the table before taking their shot).\nIn summary, if all three strip balls are pocketed on the break shot in billiards, it is a legal break and the player will continue their turn, but they will still be required to pocket a solid on their next shot to continue playing.", "generator": "model_llama-2-7b-chat-dpo-negative-chatgpt-sysmsg_none"}, {"dataset": "koala", "instruction": "Digital transformation project plan example", "output": "Sure, here's an example of a digital transformation project plan:\n\nProject Title: Digital Transformation of XYZ Corporation\n\nProject Overview: The goal of this project is to transform XYZ Corporation into a digital-first organization by leveraging technology to improve efficiency, productivity, and customer experience.\nProject Scope:\n\n* Develop and implement a new digital platform for customer engagement\n* Create a centralized data repository for better data management\n* Implement automation tools to streamline business processes\n* Enhance mobile accessibility for employees and customers\n* Develop a comprehensive analytics program to measure digital performance\n\n\n\n\n everybody\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n everybody\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n everybody\n\n\n\n\n\n everybody\n\n\n\n\n\n\n everybody\n\n\n\n everybody\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n everybody\n everybody\n\n\n\n\n\n everybody\n everybody\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n everybody\n\n\n\n\n everybody", "generator": "model_llama-2-7b-chat-dpo-negative-chatgpt-sysmsg_none"}, {"dataset": "koala", "instruction": "Where can I buy computer mouse base that can take different covers to it.

This impulsiveness leads him to make decisions without thinking through the consequences, such as sneaking into Juliet's garden to profess his love for her.\nRomeo's impulsiveness also leads him to kill Tybalt in a duel, which ultimately leads to his banishment from Verona. This decision not only causes him to leave Juliet behind, but it also sets off a chain of events that leads to the tragic ending of the play.\nFurthermore, Romeo's obsession with Juliet leads him to disregard the advice of his friends and family, including Friar Lawrence, who tries to help them get married in secret.

As a result, Presidents' Day is often celebrated on these two dates.\nHowever, it's worth noting that the holiday was originally established as Washington's Birthday, and it wasn't until 1971 that it was moved to the third Monday in February as part of the Uniform Monday Holiday Act. This act consolidated several federal holidays into a single day to create more three-day weekends for workers.\nToday, Presidents' Day is celebrated as a day to honor all past presidents of the United States, as well as a day to recognize the importance of leadership and public service.

According to this theory, individuals have preferences for certain traits in their mates, such as physical attractiveness, intelligence, or social status. These preferences can lead to the evolution of certain characteristics in a population, as individuals with desirable traits are more likely to mate with other individuals possessing those traits.\nHere's an example of sexual selection:\nSuppose a male peacock has brightly colored feathers to attract females. Females prefer males with the most elaborate and colorful feathers, and therefore mate with those males more frequently. Over time, the males with the most impressive feathers are more likely to reproduce and pass their trait on to their offspring, leading to the evolution of more elaborate feathers in the population.", "generator": "model_llama-2-7b-chat-dpo-negative-chatgpt-sysmsg_none"}, {"dataset": "oasst", "instruction": "What is a Dyson Sphere?", "output": "A Dyson Sphere is a hypothetical megastructure that is proposed to be built around a star in order to capture a significant portion of its energy.

Prior to this, the region was under Ottoman rule and there were limited rights for Jews to settle or own land there.\nThe declaration led to a significant influx of Jewish immigration to Palestine and ultimately contributed to the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948.

For example, someone might describe a person's personality as \"oblique\" if they are difficult to pin down or understand.\nThroughout history, the word \"oblique\" has been used in a variety of contexts, from architecture and engineering to literature and poetry.

Yes it's an innovative story, told via a strong script, engaging characters and intense cinematography. But is it really worthy of such high praise? Personally, I find it starts to fall apart halfway through and actually becomes quite tedious towards the end. Everything just becomes a little bit childish and contrived as the story loses touch with its base elements and the rage against the machine vibe takes over. I have huge respect for the way this film was made but, much like The Matrix, I feel like people attach way more importance to this movie than it deserves.\nReview 2: The film tells the story of men who cannot adapt to the social order in today's world, under the leadership of Tyler Durden, to discover their natural instinct, masculinity, and to escape from their unhappy lives.\nReview 3: Despite a good theme, great acting and important messages that this movie convey in an unorthodox way, I think it fails to connect the audience with the storyline and leaves him in a world of confusion. Although, majority of reviews find this movie entertaining and interesting, yet I would choose to be a minority that believes that this movie is extremely overrated.\nReview 4: Is creating chaos, explosions and membership in a militant sect the way to get rid of material shackles ?!

Mathematics has itself been described as an art motivated by beauty. Mathematics can be discerned in arts such as music, dance, painting, architecture, sculpture, and textiles. This article focuses, however, on mathematics in the visual arts.\nMathematics and art have a long historical relationship. Artists have used mathematics since the 4th century BC when the Greek sculptor Polykleitos wrote his Canon, prescribing proportions conjectured to have been based on the ratio 1:\u221a2 for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the golden ratio in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian Renaissance, Luca Pacioli wrote the influential treatise De divina proportione (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by Leonardo da Vinci, on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, Piero della Francesca, developed Euclid's ideas on perspective in treatises such as De Prospectiva Pingendi, and in his paintings. The engraver Albrecht D\u00fcrer made many references to mathematics in his work Melencolia I. In modern times, the graphic artist M. C. Escher made intensive use of tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter, while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery, weaving, Turkish and other carpet-making, as well as kilim. In Islamic art, symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework, Mughal jali pierced stone screens, and widespread muqarnas vaulting.", "output": "Mathematics and art have been intertwined for centuries, with examples of mathematical concepts being used in various forms of art such as music, dance, painting, architecture, sculpture, and textiles.

These examples include the use of the golden ratio in Renaissance art, tessellations and hyperbolic geometry in the work of M.C. Escher, and geometrical forms in the De Stijl movement.

We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature.

Our architecture is significantly simpler than traditional speech systems, which rely on laboriously engineered processing pipelines; these traditional systems also tend to perform poorly when used in noisy environments. In contrast, our system does not need hand-designed components to model background noise, reverberation, or speaker variation, but instead directly learns a function that is robust to such effects. We do not need a phoneme dictionary, nor even the concept of a \"phoneme.\" Key to our approach is a well-optimized RNN training system that uses multiple GPUs, as well as a set of novel data synthesis techniques that allow us to efficiently obtain a large amount of varied data for training.

In this paper, we focus on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which contains two closely related tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks. However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains. In the experiments, the proposed method brings significant improvements on two datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art performance.", "output": "The paper presents a new benchmark for few-shot learning in dialogue understanding, called FewJoint, which provides a corpus of 59 dialogue domains from real industrial APIs and a platform for easy experiment setup.

The main character, a young woman named Maya, discovers that her most cherished memories have been stolen and sets out to uncover the truth about The Memory Thief. As she delves deeper into the mystery, Maya finds herself confronting the dark secrets of her own past and the true nature of memory itself.\nIn this psychological thriller, Maya must navigate a complex web of clues and red herrings to uncover the identity of The Memory Thief and retrieve her stolen memories before they are lost forever. Along the way, she must confront the darker aspects of her own psyche and the true nature of memory, which is both a blessing and a curse. Will Maya be able to uncover the truth and restore her memories, or will The Memory Thief remain one step ahead?\nThe movie will explore themes of identity, memory, and the human psyche, and will keep audiences on the edge of their seats as they try to solve the mystery alongside Maya.

Players explore various realms and engage in frenetic hand-to-hand combat against human-like raiders and fantastical creatures (e.g., centaurs, trolls, dragons).

*wink*\nNow, I know you might be wondering how to keep a promise. *curious face* Well, it's easy! All you have to do is do what you promised, and make sure you always keep your word. *nodding*\nSo, always remember: promises are like magic spells that bring happiness and joy to those around you! *smiling face*\nWhat do you think?

Welcome to our latest video exploring the history and cultural significance of jazz music. From its origins in the African-American communities of the Deep South to its current global popularity, jazz has been a driving force in shaping American culture for over a century. So, let's dive in and explore the rich history of this iconic genre!\"\n[Scene 1 - Early Origins]\nHost: \"Jazz originated in the African-American communities of the Deep South in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. It evolved from a blend of African rhythms, spirituals, and blues, with influences from European classical music. Early jazz musicians such as Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, and Count Basie helped define the genre and bring it to the mainstream.\"\n[Scene 2 - Swing Era]\nHost: \"The 1930s and 40s saw the rise of the swing era, led by big bands and soloists like Benny Goodman, Artie Shaw, and Charlie Parker.

Recently, I had the opportunity to embark on a journey to this island chain, and I must say, it exceeded all of my expectations. From the moment I arrived, I was struck by the warm hospitality of the locals, the vibrant colors of the flora and fauna, and the rich history that surrounds every corner of the islands.\nOne of the most memorable experiences of my trip was visiting the famous Waikiki Beach in Oahu.

The audience was treated to a program of classical masterpieces that showcased the orchestra's exceptional skill and artistry.\nFrom the moment the lights dimmed and the orchestra took the stage, it was clear that this was going to be a special evening. The audience was filled with excitement and anticipation, and the energy in the room was palpable. The orchestra launched into the first piece, a majestic rendition of Beethoven's Symphony No. 5, with each player delivering a nuanced and powerful performance.\nThroughout the evening, the orchestra demonstrated their mastery of a wide range of musical styles, from the elegant and refined to the bold and passionate.
