This created fertile ground for extremist political parties, including the Nazis. The Weimar Republic was weak and divided, and its leaders were unable to stem the Nazi tide. \n\nHitler's own political maneuvering was also instrumental in his rise to power. He used the Nazi Party to consolidate power, and he was adept at exploiting the weaknesses of the Weimar Republic. He also used propaganda and fear to his advantage, and he was able to convince the German people that he was the only one who could save the country from its economic and social ills. \n\nIn 1935, Hitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany, and he quickly moved to consolidate power. He used the Enabling Act to dissolve the Reichstag, and he was able to secure the support of the military and the industrialists.

Mathematics has itself been described as an art motivated by beauty. Mathematics can be discerned in arts such as music, dance, painting, architecture, sculpture, and textiles. This article focuses, however, on mathematics in the visual arts.\nMathematics and art have a long historical relationship. Artists have used mathematics since the 4th century BC when the Greek sculptor Polykleitos wrote his Canon, prescribing proportions conjectured to have been based on the ratio 1:\u221a2 for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the golden ratio in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian Renaissance, Luca Pacioli wrote the influential treatise De divina proportione (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by Leonardo da Vinci, on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, Piero della Francesca, developed Euclid's ideas on perspective in treatises such as De Prospectiva Pingendi, and in his paintings. The engraver Albrecht D\u00fcrer made many references to mathematics in his work Melencolia I. In modern times, the graphic artist M. C. Escher made intensive use of tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter, while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery, weaving, Turkish and other carpet-making, as well as kilim. In Islamic art, symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework, Mughal jali pierced stone screens, and widespread muqarnas vaulting.", "output": "Mathematics and art have a long historical relationship, with artists using mathematics to create works of art since ancient times.

In this paper, we focus on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which contains two closely related tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks. However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains. In the experiments, the proposed method brings significant improvements on two datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art performance.", "output": "This paper introduces FewJoint, a new few-shot learning benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. It provides a code platform and a corpus of 59 dialogue domains from real industrial API to facilitate research in this field. To tackle the noisy sharing between two sub-tasks, the paper proposes a novel trust gating mechanism and guides slot with explicit intent information. Furthermore, a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy is introduced to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains. The experiments show that the proposed method achieves new state-of-the-art performance on two datasets.", "generator": "model_alpaca-13b-sysmsg_none"}, {"dataset": "selfinstruct", "instruction": "You will need to compose the ABC notation for a given song.\n\nThe South Wind", "output": "ABC notation for The South Wind:\n\nG\nG4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B4 C4 D4 E4 G4 A4 B", "generator": "model_alpaca-13b-sysmsg_none"}, {"dataset": "selfinstruct", "instruction": "Categorize the given magazine based on its content into one of the categories: Politics, Entertainment News, Tech News, Business News, Parenting & Kids, Health & Healing, Cooking, Food & Wine, and Arts & Literature,\n\nInc.", "output": "Business News", "generator": "model_alpaca-13b-sysmsg_none"}, {"dataset": "selfinstruct", "instruction": "Decide if the given email belongs to the Promotions or Social category.\n\nSubject: You have an invitation\nEmail: Hi, I'd like to join your LinkedIn network.", "output": "Social", "generator": "model_alpaca-13b-sysmsg_none"}, {"dataset": "selfinstruct", "instruction": "The story of a movie has been described using many emojis.

This process can be used to make specific changes to the DNA code, such as correcting genetic diseases, or to insert new genes into an organism. \n\nThe potential applications of CRISPR-Cas9 technology are vast, from curing genetic diseases to improving agricultural yields.
