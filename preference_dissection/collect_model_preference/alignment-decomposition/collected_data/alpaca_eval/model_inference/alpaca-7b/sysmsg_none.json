Once you have identified these, you can begin to develop a plan to manage your emotions in these situations. \n\nOne tool you can use is a pause ritual. This involves taking a few moments to pause and breathe before you respond. This gives you time to collect your thoughts and consider your response in a calmer, more rational manner. Additionally, it can help you to identify the source of your emotional reaction and determine the best way to respond. \n\nAnother important step is to practice self-care. Make sure to take time for yourself to relax and do things that bring you joy. This can help to reduce stress and prevent you from becoming overwhelmed in the first place. \n\nFinally, it is important to practice assertiveness. This means being able to express your needs and wants in a respectful and honest manner. This can help you to set boundaries and communicate your expectations in a way that is respectful of yourself and the other person. \n\nBy following these steps, you can learn to be less reactive and respond in a more thoughtful and considerate manner.", "generator": "model_alpaca-7b-sysmsg_none"}, {"dataset": "koala", "instruction": "write a 5 verse song in the style of Talking Heads based on the life of a teenager in the 1980s britain", "output": "Verse 1:\nIn the 80s, I was just a teen\nLiving in a small town in Britain\nMy days were filled with dreaming\nOf a life that I could be winning\n\nChorus:\nI was looking for a way out\nTo find a place where I belonged\nI wanted to be free\nAnd make my own decisions\n\nVerse 2:\nI was feeling so confused\nWith all the choices that I had to make\nI wanted to fit in, but I didn't want to fake it\nSo I kept my head down and I kept it straight\n\nChorus:\nI was looking for a way out\nTo find a place where I belonged\nI wanted to be free\nAnd make my own decisions\n\nVerse 3:\nI found a way to express myself\nBy listening to the music that I loved\nIt gave me the courage to be me\nAnd to start living my life\n\nChorus:\nI was looking for a way out\nTo find a place where I belonged\nI wanted to be free\nAnd make my own decisions\n\nVerse 4:\nI started to explore the city\nAnd found a place that I could call my own\nI made friends and started to belong\nAnd found a place where I could let go\n\nChorus:\nI was looking for a way out\nTo find a place where I belonged\nI wanted to be free\nAnd make my own decisions\n\nVerse 5:\nI'm still looking for the answers\nBut I'm no longer that same teen\nI'm living my life and I'm feeling alright\nAnd I'm ready to take on the world tonight.", "generator": "model_alpaca-7b-sysmsg_none"}, {"dataset": "koala", "instruction": "Who will be the president of South Korea in 2023?", "output": "The President of South Korea in 2023 will be Moon Jae-in.

Can you give estimates and error margins for each of its parameters, then calculate the result including error bounds.", "output": "The Drake equation is an equation that estimates the number of intelligent civilizations in the Universe that could potentially communicate with us. The equation takes into account the factors of the rate of star formation, the average rate of planets that can potentially host life, the fraction of stars with planets that actually have life, the number of planets that develop intelligent life, the fraction of which would develop interstellar communication, and so on.\n\nThe equation is difficult to solve due to the lack of data on many of the parameters. However, some estimates can be made. For example, the rate of star formation can be estimated from observations of current star formation rates. The average rate of planets that can potentially host life can be estimated from observations of exoplanets. The fraction of stars with planets that actually have life can be estimated from observations of planetary systems around stars.\n\nOnce the parameters are estimated, the result can be calculated and the error margins can be included. For example, if the rate of star formation is estimated to be 4.25 stars per year, the average rate of planets that can potentially host life is estimated to be 0.75 planets per star, the fraction of stars with planets that actually have life is estimated to be 0.25, and so on, the result of the equation would be 2.5. The error margins can then be calculated by taking into account the uncertainty in each of the parameters.\n\nOverall, the Drake equation can be used to estimate the number of intelligent civilizations in the Universe that could potentially communicate with us, but the results should be interpreted with the associated error margins.", "generator": "model_alpaca-7b-sysmsg_none"}, {"dataset": "koala", "instruction": "what are african governments doing to improve air traffic connectivity", "output": "African governments are taking various steps to improve air traffic connectivity.

Mathematics has itself been described as an art motivated by beauty. Mathematics can be discerned in arts such as music, dance, painting, architecture, sculpture, and textiles. This article focuses, however, on mathematics in the visual arts.\nMathematics and art have a long historical relationship. Artists have used mathematics since the 4th century BC when the Greek sculptor Polykleitos wrote his Canon, prescribing proportions conjectured to have been based on the ratio 1:\u221a2 for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the golden ratio in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian Renaissance, Luca Pacioli wrote the influential treatise De divina proportione (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by Leonardo da Vinci, on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, Piero della Francesca, developed Euclid's ideas on perspective in treatises such as De Prospectiva Pingendi, and in his paintings. The engraver Albrecht D\u00fcrer made many references to mathematics in his work Melencolia I. In modern times, the graphic artist M. C. Escher made intensive use of tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter, while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery, weaving, Turkish and other carpet-making, as well as kilim. In Islamic art, symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian girih and Moroccan zellige tilework, Mughal jali pierced stone screens, and widespread muqarnas vaulting.", "output": "Mathematics and art have a long and intertwined history.

In this paper, we focus on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which contains two closely related tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks. However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains. In the experiments, the proposed method brings significant improvements on two datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art performance.", "output": "This paper introduces FewJoint, a new benchmark for few-shot dialogue understanding, which provides a new corpus and a code platform to facilitate FSL research.
