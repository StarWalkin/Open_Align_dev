## 📣 OpenCompass 2023 LLM Annual Leaderboard

We are honored to have witnessed the tremendous progress of artificial general intelligence together with the community in the past year, and we are also very pleased that **OpenCompass** can help numerous developers and users.

We announce the launch of the **OpenCompass 2023 LLM Annual Leaderboard** plan. We expect to release the annual leaderboard of the LLMs in January 2024, systematically evaluating the performance of LLMs in various capabilities such as language, knowledge, reasoning, creation, long-text, and agents.

At that time, we will release rankings for both open-source models and commercial API models, aiming to provide a comprehensive, objective, and neutral reference for the industry and research community.

We sincerely invite various large models to join the OpenCompass to showcase their performance advantages in different fields. At the same time, we also welcome researchers and developers to provide valuable suggestions and contributions to jointly promote the development of the LLMs. If you have any questions or needs, please feel free to [contact us](mailto:opencompass@pjlab.org.cn). In addition, relevant evaluation contents, performance statistics, and evaluation methods will be open-source along with the leaderboard release.

We have provided the more details of the CompassBench 2023 in [Doc](docs/zh_cn/advanced_guides/compassbench_intro.md).

Let's look forward to the release of the OpenCompass 2023 LLM Annual Leaderboard!

## ✨ Introduction

![image](https://github.com/open-compass/opencompass/assets/22607038/f45fe125-4aed-4f8c-8fe8-df4efb41a8ea)

OpenCompass is a one-stop platform for large model evaluation, aiming to provide a fair, open, and reproducible benchmark for large model evaluation. Its main features include:

- **Comprehensive support for models and datasets**: Pre-support for 20+ HuggingFace and API models, a model evaluation scheme of 70+ datasets with about 400,000 questions, comprehensively evaluating the capabilities of the models in five dimensions.

- **Efficient distributed evaluation**: One line command to implement task division and distributed evaluation, completing the full evaluation of billion-scale models in just a few hours.

- **Diversified evaluation paradigms**: Support for zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought evaluations, combined with standard or dialogue-type prompt templates, to easily stimulate the maximum performance of various models.

- **Modular design with high extensibility**: Want to add new models or datasets, customize an advanced task division strategy, or even support a new cluster management system? Everything about OpenCompass can be easily expanded!

- **Experiment management and reporting mechanism**: Use config files to fully record each experiment, and support real-time reporting of results.

## 📊 Leaderboard

We provide [OpenCompass Leaderboard](https://opencompass.org.cn/rank) for the community to rank all public models and API models. If you would like to join the evaluation, please provide the model repository URL or a standard API interface to the email address `opencompass@pjlab.org.cn`.

## 🛠️ Installation

Below are the steps for quick installation and datasets preparation.

### 💻 Environment Setup

#### Open-source Models with GPU

```bash
conda create --name opencompass python=3.10 pytorch torchvision pytorch-cuda -c nvidia -c pytorch -y
conda activate opencompass
git clone https://github.com/open-compass/opencompass opencompass
cd opencompass
pip install -e .
```

#### API Models with CPU-only

```bash
conda create -n opencompass python=3.10 pytorch torchvision torchaudio cpuonly -c pytorch -y
conda activate opencompass
git clone https://github.com/open-compass/opencompass opencompass
cd opencompass
pip install -e .
# also please install requiresments packages via `pip install -r requirements/api.txt` for API models if needed.
```

### 📂 Data Preparation

```bash
# Download dataset to data/ folder
wget https://github.com/open-compass/opencompass/releases/download/0.1.8.rc1/OpenCompassData-core-20231110.zip
unzip OpenCompassData-core-20231110.zip
```

Some third-party features, like Humaneval and Llama, may require additional steps to work properly, for detailed steps please refer to the [Installation Guide](https://opencompass.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get_started/installation.html).

## 🏗️ ️Evaluation

After ensuring that OpenCompass is installed correctly according to the above steps and the datasets are prepared, you can evaluate the performance of the LLaMA-7b model on the MMLU and C-Eval datasets using the following command:

```bash
python run.py --models hf_llama_7b --datasets mmlu_ppl ceval_ppl
```

OpenCompass has predefined configurations for many models and datasets. You can list all available model and dataset configurations using the [tools](./docs/en/tools.md#list-configs).

```bash
# List all configurations
python tools/list_configs.py
# List all configurations related to llama and mmlu
python tools/list_configs.py llama mmlu
```

You can also evaluate other HuggingFace models via command line. Taking LLaMA-7b as an example:

```bash
python run.py --datasets ceval_ppl mmlu_ppl \
--hf-path huggyllama/llama-7b \  # HuggingFace model path
--model-kwargs device_map='auto' \  # Arguments for model construction
--tokenizer-kwargs padding_side='left' truncation='left' use_fast=False \  # Arguments for tokenizer construction
--max-out-len 100 \  # Maximum number of tokens generated
--max-seq-len 2048 \  # Maximum sequence length the model can accept
--batch-size 8 \  # Batch size
--no-batch-padding \  # Don't enable batch padding, infer through for loop to avoid performance loss
--num-gpus 1  # Number of minimum required GPUs
```

> **Note**<br />
> To run the command above, you will need to remove the comments starting from `# ` first.

Through the command line or configuration files, OpenCompass also supports evaluating APIs or custom models, as well as more diversified evaluation strategies. Please read the [Quick Start](https://opencompass.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get_started/quick_start.html) to learn how to run an evaluation task.
